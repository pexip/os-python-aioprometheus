Sometimes you may not want to expose Prometheus metrics from a dedicated
Prometheus metrics server but instead want to use an existing web framework.

This example uses the registry from the aioprometheus package to add
Prometheus instrumentation to a Quart application. In this example a registry
and a counter metric is instantiated and gets updated whenever the "/" route
is accessed. A '/metrics' route is added to the application using the standard
web framework method. The metrics route renders Prometheus  metrics into the
appropriate format.

Run:

  (venv) $ pip install quart
  (venv) $ python quart-example.py
